btce-bot
========

This library provides a simple framework for building trading bots for the 
BTC-e.com exchange site.  So that you don't have to spend your time chasing
down wacky dependencies, it depends only on my btce-api library:

and following standard libraries that are "batteries included" with a Python 
2.7 installation: 

    ????

NOTE: BTC-e is not affiliated with this project; this is a completely independent 
implementation based on the API description.  Use at your own risk.

If you find the library useful and would like to donate (and many thanks to 
those that have donated!), please send some coins here:
